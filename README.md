# Multifactor-detection-system-project
The Multifactor Detection System project uses AI and sensors to detect and analyze facial expressions, body movements, eye behavior, and smiles for applications in fields like emotion recognition, health monitoring, and human-computer interaction.
In this model we are going to Detect the following parameters.

1). Face
2). Eyes
3). Body
4). Smile
it is a real time model which is working on live camera to detect the above parameters.

it is developd with following tools:

1). jupiter Notebook (editor)
2). Haarcascade files.(To detect the different parameters)
3). Tkinter (used to create GUI)
4). Open CV (to Working with camera)
5). Python (to create functions)
